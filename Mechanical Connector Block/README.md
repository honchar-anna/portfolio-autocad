# 🔩 Mounting Bracket – 3D Mechanical Model (AutoCAD)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project showcases a 3D mechanical part modeled in AutoCAD based on a dimensioned technical drawing.  
The model demonstrates fundamental solid modeling techniques and serves as a training example for practicing CAD precision and visualization.

## 🛠️ Features & Skills Demonstrated

✅ **3D Solid Modeling** – Constructing the part using primitives and modification commands  
✅ **EXTRUDE / SUBTRACT / UNION** – Applying solid operations to create complex geometry  
✅ **Isometric View Setup** – Presenting the part in SE isometric view with shaded visual style  
✅ **Dimension Interpretation** – Building geometry based on technical drawing reference  
✅ **Viewport Layout** – Organizing the model for PDF output and presentation
